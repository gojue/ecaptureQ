### eCaptureQ Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** Aug 19, 2025

Welcome to eCaptureQ! This Privacy Policy explains how eCaptureQ ("the Application") handles your data. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your data.

**1. Our Privacy Commitment**

eCaptureQ is a network traffic capture and analysis tool designed for developers and network engineers. Our core principle is: **We do not collect, store, or transmit any network traffic data you capture to our servers or any third-party servers.** All data processing occurs on your device or on servers that you control.

**2. Information We Do Not Collect**

We explicitly state that this Application **does not** actively collect any of the following personal information:
*   Any network traffic data you capture through the Application, including but not limited to TLS/SSL encrypted traffic, HTTP requests/responses, DNS queries, etc.
*   Your personal identification information, such as your name, email address, or phone number.
*   Your device information, such as device ID, contact lists, or location data.
*   Any form of application usage analytics or crash report data.

**3. Information We Collect**

The Application does not collect any personal data during its operation. We may connect to our servers or code hosting platforms (like GitHub) to check for the latest version information only when you manually initiate a software update check. This process is anonymous and does not include any information that can personally identify you.

**4. How Data is Processed**

eCaptureQ offers two working modes, with data processing handled as follows:

*   **Local Mode:** When you use the Application on a local device (such as Android or Linux), all network traffic capture, analysis, and display are performed entirely on your device. Data is only stored in your device's memory or in a file system you specify and is destroyed when the application is closed (unless you actively save it).
*   **Remote Mode:** When you use the Application's client to connect to a remote server that you have deployed and control, data capture occurs on your server. The data is then transmitted over the network to your client for display. This data flow is exclusively between your own device and your own server; we cannot access this data. You are responsible for ensuring the security of the network connection between your client and server.

**5. Application Permissions**

To perform its core functions, eCaptureQ may require the following permissions on platforms like Android:
*   **Network Access:** Used to connect to your own remote server or to check for software updates.
*   **Storage Access:** Used to save captured data that you choose to export.

We promise to request and use these permissions only when necessary to implement core functionalities.

**6. Data Security**

You are solely responsible for the data you capture using this Application. We strongly recommend that you use this tool only in trusted network environments and properly secure any sensitive data you capture.

**7. Children's Privacy**

This Application is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

**8. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for the latest information.

**9. Contact Us**
